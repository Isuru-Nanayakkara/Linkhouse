Clubhouse is more than just another social media platform to some. People use it as a networking tool, advertise their services or simply showcase their hobbies.

Unfortunately Clubhouse only allows you to link to one's Twitter and Instagram. That has made many users to add links to their websites, portfolios, other social media platforms in their Clubhouse profile bio.

But those links are not clickable.
